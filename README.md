  <h3># History of SAIDA</h3>  
  <p>There is an Algorithm Contest in Samsung SDS every year. It's a developer's festival and last year('17), the subject was "Starcraft". Lots of developers participated in this festival and the contest was successful. After the contest, some developers who had a good grade in the contest gathered to make worldwide champion bot. They proposed this idea to the company and fortunately it is accepted. That is the start of 'SAIDA'. It started in January, 2018 with 8 developers.
